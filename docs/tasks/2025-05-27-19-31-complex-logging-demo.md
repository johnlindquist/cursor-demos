# Task: Complex Logging Demo Application - Multi-tier Flow Architecture

## Commit 1: feat: implement backend API with complex service layer architecture
**Description:**
Create a comprehensive backend API structure with multiple interconnected services that demonstrate complex business logic flows. This includes setting up Express.js with TypeScript, implementing a user service, order service, payment service, inventory service, and notification service. Each service will have dependencies on others, creating a complex call chain. Files to be created/modified: `apps/logging-demo/src/main.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/src/services/user.service.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/src/services/order.service.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/src/services/payment.service.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/src/services/inventory.service.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/src/services/notification.service.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/src/controllers/api.controller.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/src/types/index.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/src/utils/database.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/src/middleware/validation.ts`.

**Verification:**
1. **Automated Test(s):**
   * **Command:** `pnpm nx test logging-demo --testPathPattern=services`
   * **Expected Outcome:** All service unit tests pass, verifying individual service methods work correctly with mock dependencies
2. **Logging Check:**
   * **Action:** Start server with `pnpm nx serve logging-demo` and make POST request to `/api/orders` with valid order data
   * **Expected Log:** Console output shows successful order creation flow without any logging statements (baseline for later logging addition)
   * **Toggle Mechanism:** No logging implemented yet - this establishes the baseline

## Commit 2: feat: add frontend React application with complex user interactions
**Description:**
Create a React frontend application that interacts with the backend services through multiple user flows. Implement components for user registration, product browsing, shopping cart, checkout process, and order tracking. The frontend will make sequential API calls that trigger the complex backend flows. Files to be created: `apps/logging-demo/src/public/index.html`, `apps/logging-demo/src/frontend/App.tsx`, `apps/logging-demo/src/frontend/components/UserRegistration.tsx`, `apps/logging-demo/src/frontend/components/ProductCatalog.tsx`, `apps/logging-demo/src/frontend/components/ShoppingCart.tsx`, `apps/logging-demo/src/frontend/components/Checkout.tsx`, `apps/logging-demo/src/frontend/components/OrderTracking.tsx`, `apps/logging-demo/src/frontend/services/api.service.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/src/frontend/hooks/useOrder.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/src/frontend/types/index.ts`. Update `apps/logging-demo/src/main.ts` to serve static frontend files.

**Verification:**
1. **Automated Test(s):**
   * **Command:** `pnpm nx test logging-demo --testPathPattern=frontend`
   * **Expected Outcome:** Frontend component tests pass, verifying user interactions trigger correct API calls and state updates
2. **Logging Check:**
   * **Action:** Open browser to `http://localhost:3333`, complete full user flow from registration through order placement
   * **Expected Log:** Browser network tab shows successful API calls, no console errors, complex flow completes end-to-end
   * **Toggle Mechanism:** No logging implemented yet - verifying functional baseline

## Commit 3: feat: implement async job processing and external service integrations
**Description:**
Add asynchronous job processing capabilities and external service integrations to increase complexity. Implement a job queue system for order processing, email notifications, and inventory updates. Add external service simulators for payment processing, shipping providers, and third-party analytics. Files to be created: `apps/logging-demo/src/jobs/order-processor.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/src/jobs/email-sender.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/src/jobs/inventory-updater.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/src/external/payment-gateway.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/src/external/shipping-provider.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/src/external/analytics-service.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/src/queue/job-queue.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/src/workers/background-worker.ts`. Update service files to integrate with job queue and external services.

**Verification:**
1. **Automated Test(s):**
   * **Command:** `pnpm nx test logging-demo --testPathPattern=jobs|external`
   * **Expected Outcome:** Job processing and external service integration tests pass, verifying async operations complete successfully
2. **Logging Check:**
   * **Action:** Place order through frontend and wait 30 seconds for background job processing to complete
   * **Expected Log:** Console shows job completion messages, external service responses, and async operation results
   * **Toggle Mechanism:** No logging implemented yet - establishing complex async flow baseline

## Commit 4: feat: add error scenarios and edge cases for comprehensive flow testing
**Description:**
Implement various error scenarios and edge cases to demonstrate complex error handling flows. Add scenarios for payment failures, inventory shortages, network timeouts, validation errors, and service unavailability. Create endpoints that can trigger these scenarios for testing purposes. Files to be created: `apps/logging-demo/src/scenarios/error-scenarios.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/src/middleware/error-handler.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/src/utils/circuit-breaker.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/src/utils/retry-logic.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/src/controllers/test-scenarios.controller.ts`. Update existing services to handle error conditions gracefully.

**Verification:**
1. **Automated Test(s):**
   * **Command:** `pnpm nx test logging-demo --testPathPattern=error|scenarios`
   * **Expected Outcome:** Error handling tests pass, verifying system gracefully handles various failure modes
2. **Logging Check:**
   * **Action:** Trigger error scenarios via `/api/test-scenarios/payment-failure` and `/api/test-scenarios/inventory-shortage` endpoints
   * **Expected Log:** Console shows error handling without detailed logging - establishing baseline for error flow complexity
   * **Toggle Mechanism:** No logging implemented yet - preparing complex error flows for future logging demonstration

## Commit 5: test: comprehensive integration testing and curl command verification
**Description:**
Create comprehensive integration tests that verify the entire application flow works correctly. Implement test scripts that can be run via curl commands to validate all endpoints and complex flows. Create a test runner script that exercises the full application functionality. Files to be created: `apps/logging-demo/tests/integration/full-flow.test.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/tests/integration/error-scenarios.test.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/scripts/test-endpoints.sh`, `apps/logging-demo/scripts/load-test.sh`, `apps/logging-demo/tests/helpers/test-data.ts`, `apps/logging-demo/tests/helpers/api-client.ts`.

**Verification:**
1. **Automated Test(s):**
   * **Command:** `pnpm nx test logging-demo --testPathPattern=integration`
   * **Expected Outcome:** All integration tests pass, verifying end-to-end functionality works correctly across all services
2. **Logging Check:**
   * **Action:** Run `chmod +x apps/logging-demo/scripts/test-endpoints.sh && ./apps/logging-demo/scripts/test-endpoints.sh`
   * **Expected Log:** Script output shows all curl commands succeed with expected responses, demonstrating working complex flows
   * **Toggle Mechanism:** Test script includes verification commands that confirm application responds correctly without logging infrastructure
